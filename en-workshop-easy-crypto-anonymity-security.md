Encryption or anonymity?
=======


- Usinf WhatsApp, Messenger or Telegram, your messages are encrypted, however the metadata (addresses of whom you're talking with) are not
- Metadata is often enough. [The Verizon case](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order)



Anonymous communications
=========


<ul>
    <li>Create and use a dead box, disconnected from your identity</li>
    <li class="fragment">Send notes <em>to Mission Impossible</em> with <a href="https://privnote.com/">Privnote</a> or <a href="https://zerobin.net/">Zerobin</a></li>
    <li class="fragment">Work collaboratively <strong>AND</strong> encrypted with <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/what-is-cryptpad.html">CryptPad</a><small> (can also be used on the same principle as the dead box)</small></a></li>
</ul>



Secure communications
=========


<ul>
    <li>Encrypt your mails with <a href="https://protonmail.com/">Proton Mail</a> or <a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2pJ5h7a_o8">tutorial for tutanota (en)</a> </li>
    <li class="fragment">Use <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> on your smartphone <strong>AND</strong> on your computer</li>
    <li class="fragment">Do you use another application? Discord, WhatsApp, iMessage, Telegram, etc.? <a href="https://www.messenger-matrix.de/messenger-matrix-en.html">Check how secure your favorite app is</a>.</li>
</ul>
Note: insta messages are not end-to-end encrypted, but only from the smartphone to Meta's servers and then from the server to the recipient's smartphone</aside>
