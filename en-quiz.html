		<h1>Question #1</h1>  
		<p><strong>zUo!7$r</strong> &rarr; Is this a robust password?</p>
	</section>
  <section>
  <h2>NO</h2>
    <p>The use of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters does not garantee that a password is safe. The number of character in a password is the most important. So forget about passwords and use <strong><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/936/">passphrases</a></strong>.</p>
