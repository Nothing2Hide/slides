<aside class="notes">A journalist working in France must learn how to protect his or her sources, but the situation (and therefore the tools they will use) are very different than for someone working in an environment where the rule of law does not apply.
</aside>
</section>

<section>
You need to learn which tools and which best practices fit your own specific situation and environment.
<aside class="notes">If you have ever attended a digital safety workshop, you’ve probably been taught how to create strong passwords, how to encrypt a folder or an external hard drive, and how to activate two-factor authentication on your online messaging services. All that is fine. But it’s often not enough.</aside>

		<h2>Context</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>Journalists from an independent Syrian media outlet based in Istanbul asked for Nothing2Hide help to make their systems secure. They are in a very delicate situation; they work on a daily basis with journalists based inside Syria.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">No Google Drive or dropbox (an explicit request on the journalists’ part)</li>
			<li class="fragment">installation of a software allowing the team to save and encrypt files on N2H servers with a click of the mouse</li>
			<li class="fragment">with a non blocked VPN in Turkey (WireGuard rather than open vpn)</li>

	<section>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Plan A: Internet connection</h3>
		Photos uploaded once a day to one of our servers. When the upload was complete, the files were copied onto a second server and erased from the first
	</section>	
	<section>
		<h3>Plan B: no Internet connection</h3>
		Files encryptted using veracrypt an hidden amongst multimedia files as .mp3 or .mov.
