Data sent by your smartphone
=======================
</section>
<section data-markdown>
In communication
----------------
-   The GSM network encryption algorithm has been compromised for a long
    time
-   Legal interception: since 2015 and the intelligence law, the use of
    IMSI catchers is allowed
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Standby mode
--------
-   IMSI#: unique identifier your SIM card
-   IMEI#: unique identifier your phone (changing sim is not enough)
-   The network cell: from a few meters to several kilometers
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Bonus #1
---------
[Many software programs](http://www.gsmespion.com/) can turn your smartphone into a spy microphone. However, they must be installed on your phone.
</section>

Bonus #2
---------

<aside class="notes">

<section data-markdown>
Turned off
----------
The battery, plugged in, is still a source of energy. With the collaboration of the telephone operator, which can access the packets sent to the SIM card (Application Protocol Data Unit), the phone can theoretically be activated.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
Battery removed
---------------
Without a battery, there is no power, no transmitted signals, no monitoring.

Application rights and permissions
==================================
Just like on a computer workstation you don\'t install just any
application on your smartphone. You have to check the rights that an
application claims on your smartphone. Ex: is it normal that a
flashlight application claims access to your contacts?
</section>
<section data-markdown>

The Basics
----
-   Protect your Android or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/HT204060) smartphone with a password (more than 20 characters or delete after 10 attempts)
-   Encrypt the content of your smartphone on, [Android](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2844831?hl=en&sjid=14526544971493108138-EU) or [iOS](https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/)
Note: Under ios the content is encrypted automatically, from the moment you set a code. Do not forget the data on external memories (SD cards, sim card) and possibly stored in the cloud (automatically encrypted under ios but not necessarily with other services).
